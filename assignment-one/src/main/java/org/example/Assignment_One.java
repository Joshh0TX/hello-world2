 * This is an example of Javadoc
 * Provides the classes necessary to create an
 * applet and the classes an applet uses
 * to communicate with its applet context.
 * <p>
 * The applet framework involves two entities:
 * the applet and the applet context.
 * An applet is an embeddable window (see the
 * {@link java.awt.Panel} class) with a few extra
 * methods that the applet context can use to
 * initialize, start, and stop the applet.
